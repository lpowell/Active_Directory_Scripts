# Active_Directory_Scripts
A collection of scripts that are useful for Active Directory servers. Primarily made to help in CCDC, but they are also generally helpful scripts outside of the competition.

#EnumtoWebPage
This generates a static website that contains html pages for processes, services, users, tasks, and active directory information. 
Eventually, it will be expanded to include more information and a generated summary of results. 
The original goal was to make some nice & easy to read enumeration output, as dumping everything to a text file is definitely not the best way to do it.
